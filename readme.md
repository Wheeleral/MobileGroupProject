Hi!

So you're interested in this project?

Included in this file is a:

design.md which is a markdown about our design for part 1.

the folder images/ includes our graphs

Deliverables/GroupProjectVideo.mp4 is the video

app-debug.apk is the apk for this project!

This project was the culmination of projects 1-4 for CS4518. This application allows a user to take a picture, run a custom made deep learning model on the picture to determine which animal the picture is of( both on device and on cloud).
Finally the user can save the photo to a database, which is sorted by category, to view the image later.
