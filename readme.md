Hi!

So you're interested in this project?

Included in this file is a:

design.md which is a markdown about our design

performance.md which is a markdown about our performance measurements

_________ is the video

app-debug.apk is the apk for this project!

this project was the culmination of porjects 1-4 for CS4518. this application allows a user to take a picture, run a deep learning model on the picture to determine which animal the picture is of( both on device and on cloud)
and finally the user can save the photo to a database, which is sorted by category, to view the image later.
